# TAU. An application launcher made for first class Wayland support

I mainly have wanted to make this because there's
really not many actively maintained wayland app
launcher alternatives to rofi. This is my first fully open source project I am actively working on, so bare with my noobish skills, and of course contributions are encouraged! :)

## Wayland support, and full customization.

Something that a lot of these awesome app launchers
do is allow for loads of customization. I want to
be able to set up the infrastructure of this app so
that it is incredibly easy to modify, with css for
styling so people can quickly learn, even if they
don't have programming experience.
